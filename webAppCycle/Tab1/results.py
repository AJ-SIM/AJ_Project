\section*{ASHRAE 62.1 Dew Point Limit}

According to Addendum ae to ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016, mechanically cooled buildings must be equipped with dehumidification systems that limit the indoor air dew point to a maximum of 60\textdegree F (15.6\textdegree C) during both occupied and unoccupied hours, especially when the outdoor air dew point exceeds this value. This requirement aims to reduce the risk of microbial growth by controlling the amount of moisture available for condensation or absorption on building surfaces.

\section*{Importance of Dew Point Control}

Managing the indoor dew point is essential because:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label={--}]
    \item \textbf{Moisture Control:} Limiting the dew point reduces the potential for condensation on cooler surfaces, which can lead to mold growth and structural damage.
    \item \textbf{Indoor Air Quality (IAQ):} Lower dew points help maintain better IAQ by minimizing conditions favorable to allergens and microbial proliferation.
    \item \textbf{Energy Efficiency:} Proper humidity control can enhance HVAC system efficiency by reducing the latent load, leading to energy savings.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Exceptions and Considerations}

There are exceptions to the dew point limit requirement:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label={--}]
    \item \textbf{Non-Mechanically Cooled Spaces:} Buildings or spaces without mechanical cooling equipment are exempt, as their surfaces typically remain warmer, reducing condensation risks.
    \item \textbf{Special Use Areas:} Spaces designed to handle higher humidity levels, such as shower rooms or swimming pool enclosures, may be exempt if they utilize materials and systems resistant to moisture damage.
    \item \textbf{Short Unoccupied Periods:} During overnight unoccupied periods not exceeding 12 hours, the 60\textdegree F dew point limit does not apply, provided that indoor relative humidity does not exceed 65\% at any time during those hours.
\end{itemize}
